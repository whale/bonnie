# Bonnie — Project CLAUDE.md

## What This Is

One-page website for a relationship coaching practice. The client (Bonnie) is a relationship coach using Relational Life Therapy (RLT). The site needs to be direct, personal, and clearly differentiated from generic coaching sites.

## Key Files

- `brief.md` — The full content strategy. All copy, section structure, strategic notes, and design direction live here. This is the source of truth for what the site says and why.

## Content Strategy Summary

The site has 9 sections:
1. **Hero** — Core message: "You're not broken. You're stuck in a pattern."
2. **Recognition** — "This might sound familiar" — makes the visitor feel seen
3. **The Reframe** — Pattern problem, not communication problem
4. **How I Work** — RESET framework (Reveal, Explore, Strengthen, Engage, Tend)
5. **What I Don't Do** — Differentiation by contrast (Basecamp-style)
6. **Transformation Story** — Social proof (placeholder testimonials)
7. **Pricing** — Transparent, on the page
8. **About** — Her story, credentials, philosophy
9. **Final CTA** — Book a free 15-minute call

**Primary CTA:** Book a free 15-minute intro call (appears in hero, after RESET, and at bottom).

## Design Direction

- Warm, minimal, professional. Mobile-first.
- Warm neutrals + confident accent (deep terracotta, sage, or warm navy). Plenty of white space.
- Clean typography — humanist sans-serif or serif for headlines, clean sans for body.
- Photo placeholders (styled gray boxes) — her photo is the primary visual.
- **Avoid:** Stock photos, gradients, coaching clichés (lotus, sunsets, mountaintops), pastel "wellness" palettes, overly rounded everything.

## Stack

- **Plain HTML + CSS** — no build tools, no framework. Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
- **Google Fonts** — DM Serif Display (headlines) + Inter (body)
- **Hosting:** TBD (Vercel, Netlify, or similar static hosting)
- **Booking integration:** TBD (Calendly embed or similar — CTA buttons currently link to `#contact`)

## Decisions Made

- Content strategy is finalized in `brief.md` — treat it as approved copy unless the user says otherwise.
- Tone: warm but direct. Basecamp clarity meets emotional intelligence.

## Open Questions

- Stack choice
- Domain name
- Booking tool (Calendly? Something else?)
- Real testimonials (currently placeholders)
- Coach's actual headshot/photos (currently placeholders)
