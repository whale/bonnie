# Website Content Strategy & Brief
## Relationship Coaching Practice — One-Page Site

---

## Overview

This is a content strategy for a one-page relationship coaching website. The site needs to be direct, personal, and strategically differentiated from the sea of vague coaching sites online. It is based on ~44 minutes of recorded interview responses, analyzed through Made to Stick (SUCCESs framework) and The Challenger Sale methodology.

The site must do five things extremely well:
1. Say what she does
2. Say what she doesn't do
3. Explain how she does it
4. Communicate why she does it
5. Establish why she's qualified

**Tone:** Warm but direct. Think Basecamp's clarity crossed with emotional intelligence. No coaching clichés. No sunsets, no stock photos of diverse groups laughing, no "safe space" language. Personal, potent, clear.

**Primary CTA:** Book a free 15-minute intro call.

**Design direction:** Warm, minimal, professional. Mobile-first. Her photo should be the primary visual (use placeholder boxes for now). White space matters. Avoid over-designed or overly "wellness" aesthetics.

## Core Message (Made to Stick — Simple)

**You're not broken. You're stuck in a pattern. I help you see it, name it, and change it.**

Everything on the site ladders back to this. The client is not defective. The relationship is not doomed. There is a pattern operating beneath the surface, it was probably adaptive once, and it can be changed with the right support and practice.

## Key Strategic Insights

### Challenger Sale — The Reframe
The visitor arrives thinking: "We need help communicating" or "My partner needs to change." The site teaches them something they didn't know: **You don't have a communication problem. You have a pattern problem.**

### Made to Stick — Unexpected (Pattern Interrupts)
- She works with the parts of you that DON'T want to do the work — not just the willing, curious side
- She takes sides (surprising to people)
- You don't need your partner to become a different person — a 10% shift can feel like everything changed
- People come to change their partner and leave having changed themselves
- Real homework between sessions — not "vent and feel better for an hour"

### Made to Stick — Emotional Targets
- **Relief:** "Someone finally gets it. Someone can name what I can't."
- **Hope:** "This can actually be different. It doesn't require a miracle."
- **Courage:** "This won't be comfortable, but she's clearly done it herself."
- **Empowerment:** "I'm not broken. There's a pattern, and I can learn to change it."

## Content Blocks (Section by Section)

### SECTION 1 — Hero

**Headline:** You're not broken. You're stuck in a pattern.

**Body:** I help individuals and couples who feel stuck in the same fights, the same distance, the same cycles of conflict — uncover the patterns driving it and replace them with something that actually works.

Relationship coaching that's direct, structured, and built on real practice — not just talking about your feelings.

**CTA Button:** Book a Free 15-Minute Call

**Strategic note:** This is the Made-to-Stick "Simple" principle: one clear idea. It's also the Challenger "Teach" move — reframing from "we're broken" to "there's a pattern." The second line immediately differentiates from passive therapy.

---

### SECTION 2 — Recognition ("This might sound familiar")

**Headline:** This might sound familiar.

**Body:**
You're lying awake at 2am wondering if your kids can feel the tension. You're performing well at work while your home life quietly falls apart. Or maybe you're single and you keep ending up in the same relationship with a different person.

You've probably tried talking it out. Maybe you've been to therapy before — individually or together. It helped for a minute. Then the same patterns came back.

You don't need someone to listen to you vent. You need someone who can see what you can't, name it, and help you change it.

**Strategic note:** Every phrase here is pulled directly from her description of her ideal clients. The 2am detail and the "performing at work / drowning at home" paradox are from her transcripts. This section should make the visitor feel seen before a single word about services appears.

---

### SECTION 3 — The Reframe

**Headline:** You don't have a communication problem. You have a pattern problem.

**Body:**
Every couple I work with says the same thing at first: "We just need help communicating." But communication is the symptom, not the root. Underneath the fights about dishes and bedtimes and money is a pattern — what I call a stance and dance — that both of you have been running since long before you met each other.

These patterns were smart once. As a kid, withdrawing or people-pleasing or over-functioning kept you safe. But what protected you then is now the thing driving your partner crazy — and vice versa.

The good news: once you can see the pattern, you can start to change it. And it takes far less change than you think. You don't need your partner to become a different person. You need a shift of about 10% — and it can feel like everything changed.

**Strategic note:** This is the heart of the Challenger "Teach" methodology. It gives the visitor new language ("stance and dance," "pattern problem"), reframes their understanding, and introduces hope with the "10% shift" insight.

### SECTION 4 — How I Work (RESET Framework)

**Headline:** This isn't open-ended talk therapy. There's a structure.

**Intro:** I use a framework called RESET. It's grounded in Relational Life Therapy (RLT) — a direct, action-oriented approach developed by Terry Real that's fundamentally different from traditional couples therapy.

**Step R — Reveal:**
We map the patterns. Not just the complaints — the deeper stances and cycles driving them. We name what's actually going on, and we agree on what we're working to change.

**Step E — Explore:**
We work with the protective parts of you that don't want to change. The part that lashes out. The part that withdraws. The part that over-functions. This is where most coaching stops. It's where mine starts.

**Step S — Strengthen:**
You build what's called "second consciousness" — the ability to see yourself in the middle of a reaction and choose something different. We practice this. With real tools. Between sessions.

**Step E — Engage:**
You learn real repair. Not "I'm sorry you feel that way." Actual accountability, actual vulnerability, actual movement back toward each other.

**Step T — Tend:**
The relationship becomes a practice — not a problem to be fixed. We shift from crisis management to conscious partnership. You don't leave "cured." You leave equipped.

**Strategic note:** Each step is named and explained in plain language. The "Explore" step is the key differentiator and should get visual emphasis. Consider a stepper/timeline layout, icons for each step, or cards.

### SECTION 5 — What I Don't Do

**Headline:** A few things I should be upfront about.

**Body:**
I don't sit quietly and let you vent for an hour. That might feel good in the moment, but it doesn't change anything. I'm direct. I'll tell you what I see — with kindness and respect — but I won't pretend everything's fine when it isn't.

I'm not a therapist, and I don't diagnose conditions or prescribe medication. If you're in active addiction or managing an undiagnosed psychiatric condition, we'll talk about getting you the right support first — and I'll be here when you're ready.

I don't do this work for you. I give you real homework. Real practices. Things to do between sessions that rewire the patterns we're working on. Change requires practice — not just insight.

I also take sides. Not permanently, and not unfairly — but I will name what's happening in the room even when it's uncomfortable. That's how things actually shift.

**Strategic note:** Basecamp-inspired. Defining by contrast. Saying what you DON'T do is often more powerful than saying what you do. The "I take sides" line is surprising and memorable.

---

### SECTION 6 — Transformation Story (Social Proof)

**Pull quote:** "I came into this not knowing what to expect. If you had told me this would be the result, I wouldn't have believed you."

**Body:**
One client came to me as a last resort. On paper, he had everything — the title, the salary, the house, the family. Inside, he was drowning. Disconnected from his wife, burned out at work, going through the motions.

He wasn't bought in at first. Most people aren't. But as we worked together — identifying the patterns running his life, building his capacity to show up differently — something shifted. Not overnight. Through practice.

By the time we finished, he was — and I don't say this lightly — visibly a different person. More present. More connected. Not because he'd been fixed, but because he'd been empowered to see what was driving him and choose something different.

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert 1–2 direct testimonial quotes when available]**

**Strategic note:** Starts with skepticism (which the visitor likely shares) and ends with transformation that feels earned rather than magical. Replace with named testimonials when she provides them.

---

### SECTION 7 — Pricing

**Headline:** Simple, straightforward pricing.

- **Free 15-minute intro call** — We meet briefly so you can ask questions and see if this feels like the right fit. No commitment.
- **First session (90 minutes)** — $175. This is where we dig in, map what's going on, and build a plan together.
- **Ongoing individual sessions (50 minutes)** — $125.
- **Ongoing couples sessions (50 minutes)** — $150.

I work with clients virtually and can work across state lines. Sessions are typically weekly or biweekly, and most clients see real change within 3–4 months.

**Strategic note:** Pricing on the page is a Challenger "Take Control" move. Eliminates the "I wonder how much this costs" hesitation. The "3–4 months" timeline manages expectations.

### SECTION 8 — About / Her Story (Condensed for One-Pager)

**Headline:** I didn't become a coach because I read about it in a textbook.

**Body:**
I became a coach because I had to. Every chapter of this work started with something breaking open in my own life — a health crisis that led to health coaching, the loss of my son that led to meditation and mindfulness work, and personal relational pain that led me to Relational Life Therapy.

Along the way, I've led 30-day immersive retreat programs around the world, designed coaching curriculum that became a financial firm's leadership culture, and coached over 250 people one-on-one through organizational change, conflict, and growth.

I'm not coaching from a textbook. I've lived through abusive relationships, grief, addiction in my family, and my own reckoning with every pattern I now help my clients see in themselves. That's not a pitch. It's just the truth.

**What I believe:** People are whole. Not damaged goods that need fixing. Almost no one was taught how to be in a healthy relationship — it wasn't modeled for us. That's not a character flaw. It's a skill gap. And skills can be learned.

**Strategic note:** This is the credibility section. Vulnerability is measured — honest without being gratuitous. The "skill gap, not character flaw" reframe is powerful destigmatization.

---

### SECTION 9 — Final CTA

**Headline:** You don't have to keep doing this alone.

**Body:** Book a free 15-minute call. I'll share how I work, you'll ask your questions, and we'll both know if it's the right fit. No pressure, no pitch.

**CTA Button:** Book Your Free Call

**Strategic note:** Repeat the CTA from the hero. The headline shifts from informational to invitational. Keep the language warm and low-pressure. The visitor has read a lot at this point — they just need permission to take the step.

## Design & Implementation Notes

- **Mobile-first.** Most visitors will arrive on phones.
- **Photo placeholders:** Use styled gray boxes with labels like "[HEADSHOT]" and "[LIFESTYLE PHOTO]". Her face should be prominent — hero and about sections at minimum.
- **RESET section:** Consider a horizontal stepper on desktop / vertical on mobile with icons or numbers for each step.
- **Color palette:** Warm, not clinical. Avoid blues and greens that read "corporate wellness." Think warm neutrals, a confident accent color (deep terracotta, sage, warm navy), and plenty of white space.
- **Typography:** Clean, readable. One serif or humanist sans-serif for headlines, a clean sans for body. Nothing script or overly decorative.
- **Avoid:** Stock photography, gradients, coaching clichés (lotus flowers, sunsets, people on mountaintops), overly rounded corners on everything, pastel palettes that feel soft and unserious.
- **CTA buttons** should appear at minimum in the hero, after the RESET section, and at the bottom. Same button text and destination throughout.
- **The "What I Don't Do" section** is a powerful differentiator — give it visual weight, don't bury it.
